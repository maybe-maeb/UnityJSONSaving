This is a simple method of writing and reading save and setting info to the disk.

Files are saved in JSON in the default Unity registry (C:/Users/{USERNAME}/AppData/LocalLow/<COMPANYNAME>/<PROJECTNAME>/)

This isn't the best or most efficient way of going about this, but it's a solution that is easy to understand, and can be easily modified.

I'm uploading this mostly for use by myself in future projects, but if you stumble across this, you're welcome to use it in your own projects!

This is a simple method of writing and reading save and setting info to the disk.

Files are saved in JSON in the default Unity registry (C:/Users/USERNAME/AppData/LocalLow/COMPANYNAME/PROJECTNAME>)

I'm uploading this mostly for use by myself in future projects, but if you stumble across this, you're welcome to use it in your own projects!
